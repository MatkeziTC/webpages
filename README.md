# Webpages Project

This project contains multiple versions of a simple web page. Each version is available as a separate HTML file in the repository.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - Clone the repo using `git clone <repo-url>` or download the ZIP and extract it.
2. **Open Locally:**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser. This will show a landing page where you can choose which version to view.
   - Alternatively, open any of the version files directly (`v2.html`, `v3.html`, `v5.html`).
3. **No Build Step Required:**
   - These are static HTML files. No installation or build process is needed.
